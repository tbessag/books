  "Summary": "As data management continues to evolve rapidly, managing all of your data in a central place, such as a data warehouse, is no longer scalable. Today's world is about quickly turning data into value. This requires a paradigm shift in the way we federate responsibilities, manage data, and make it available to others. With this practical book, you'll learn how to design a next-gen data architecture that takes into account the scale you need for your organization. Executives, architects and engineers, analytics teams, and compliance and governance staff will learn how to build a next-gen data landscape. Author Piethein Strengholt provides blueprints, principles, observations, best practices, and patterns to get you up to speed. Examine data management trends, including regulatory requirements, privacy concerns, and new developments such as data mesh and data fabric Go deep into building a modern data architecture, including cloud data landing zones, domain-driven design, data product design, and more Explore data governance and data security, master data management, self-service data marketplaces, and the importance of metadata"
