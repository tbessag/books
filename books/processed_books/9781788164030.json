  "Summary": "'There are some fantastic books out there that men should read ... It really worked' Coleen Nolan, ITV's Loose WomenDid you know that the clitoris has 8000 nerve endings, twice as many as the penis? Here is everything you've wondered about the female orgasm and how to make it happen. A witty, well-researched and revealing guide to giving your lover an orgasm every time. More than just foreplay, Ian Kerner argues that oral sex is the key to a great sex life for both partners. Short sections cover philosophy, technique, step-by-step instructions and detailed anatomical information, essential to both beginners and experienced lovers.'It's time to close the sex gap and create a level playing field in the exchange of pleasure, and cunnilingus is far more than just a means for achieving this noble end; it's the cornerstone of a new sexual paradigm, one that exuberantly extols a shared experience of pleasure, intimacy, respect and contentment. It's also one of the greatest gifts of love a man can bestow upon a woman.' Ian Kerner"
