  "Summary": "'A fantastic book.' WIRED 'Witty and instructive.' WALL STREET JOURNAL 'Invaluable for anyone wanting to make long-lasting change a reality.' BBC FOCUS 'A must-read.' FORBES ______________________________________________ We all know that change is hard. It's unsettling, it's time-consuming, and all too often we give up at the first sign of a setback. But why do we insist on seeing the obstacles rather than the goal? This is the question that bestselling authors Chip and Dan Heath tackle in their compelling and insightful book. They argue that we need to understand how our minds function in order to unlock shortcuts to switch up our behaviours. Illustrating their ideas with scientific studies and remarkable real-life turnarounds - from the secrets of successful marriage counselling to the pile of gloves that transformed one company's finances - the brothers Heath prove that deceptively simple methods can yield truly extraordinary results. In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change."
