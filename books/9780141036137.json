  "Summary": "The perfect edition for any Orwell enthusiasts' collection, discover Orwell's classic dystopian masterpiece beautifully reimagined by renowned street artist Shepard Fairey 'All animals are equal. But some animals are more equal than others.' Mr Jones of Manor Farm is so lazy and drunken that one day he forgets to feed his livestock. The ensuing rebellion under the leadership of the pigs Napoleon and Snowball leads to the animals taking over the farm. Vowing to eliminate the terrible inequities of the farmyard, the renamed Animal Farm is organised to benefit all who walk on four legs. But as time passes, the ideals of the rebellion are corrupted, then forgotten. And something new and unexpected emerges. . . First published in 1945, Animal Farm - the history of a revolution that went wrong - is George Orwell's brilliant satire on the corrupting influence of power. 'Remains our great satire of the darker face of modern history' Malcolm Bradbury 'A prophet who thought the unthinkable and spoke the unspeakable, even when it offended conventional thought' Daily Express 'As valid today as it was fifty years ago' Ralph Steadman COMPLETE THE TRIO WITH SHEPARD FAIREY'S NEW-LOOK 1984 AND DOWN AND OUT IN PARIS AND LONDON."
